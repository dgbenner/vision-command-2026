# Vision Command 2026

*A gaze-controlled homage to Atari's **Missile Command** built for macOS Vision Accessibility*

## Overview

**Vision Command 2026** is a simple arcade-style prototype where you defend cities from falling missiles using **eye tracking and face gestures** instead of a mouse or keyboard.

It's designed as:

* A **playful demo** of macOS **Pointer Control / Vision Accessibility**
* A **testbed** for gaze target selection, dwell timing, and large-hit-area UI
* An example of how classic arcade games can be reimagined for **hands-free play**

You move a targeting reticle with your **eyes** and fire interceptors with **blinks or dwell** to destroy incoming missiles before they hit your cities.

---

## System Requirements

* **OS:** macOS Sonoma (14.0) or newer
* **Hardware:**
  + Mac with FaceTime HD camera (minimum)
  + TrueDepth camera recommended for enhanced face gesture support
* **Accessibility:** macOS Pointer Control enabled (System Settings → Accessibility → Pointer Control)

---

## Core Gameplay

* A row of **cities** sits at the bottom of the screen.
* **Enemy missiles** fall from the top toward random cities.
* You control a **crosshair** with your gaze.
* When your gaze rests on a location and you trigger a **fire gesture**, an interceptor launches upward and explodes in a small radius.
* Any enemy missiles that pass through the explosion are destroyed.
* If all cities are destroyed, the game ends.

This is intentionally **slower-paced** than the original Missile Command to match the realities of gaze input (limited precision and higher fatigue).

---

## Controls (Gaze + Face Gestures)

Gaze and gesture mapping is intentionally simple and forgiving:

### Pointer / Aim

* **Move reticle**: Your eyes move the system pointer via macOS **Pointer Control** (Vision → Eye Tracking).
* The game continuously reads pointer position and keeps the **crosshair** centered on it.

### Fire / Action

**Recommended for first-time users:** Start with **dwell-to-fire** as it requires no additional gesture configuration and works immediately after eye tracking calibration.

You can choose one (or support multiple):

* **Dwell-to-fire** *(Recommended Default)*

  + Rest your gaze (pointer) on a spot for *X ms* (e.g., 500–700 ms).
  + Game interprets this as a "click" and launches an interceptor.
* **Blink-to-fire**

  + Map a **blink** or **eye-closure gesture** in macOS Accessibility as a "click-equivalent" action.
  + Game treats click events as firing commands at the current crosshair location.
* **Eyebrow Raise or Mouth Open (Optional)**

  + You can map a **face gesture** (raised eyebrows, open mouth) to a click.
  + Great as an alternative to dwell if users find long staring tiring.

### Pause / Menu

* **Look at a corner** (e.g., top-left safe zone) and **dwell** for >1 second to open a basic pause menu.
* Alternatively, use a standard keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Esc`) for non-hands-free testing.

**New to gaze control?** See `/docs/setup-guide.md` for step-by-step instructions on enabling and calibrating macOS Pointer Control.

## Design Goals

1. **Large Targets, Slow Pace**

   * Incoming missiles are slower than in the original arcade game.
   * Explosion radius is slightly generous.
   * This gives gaze time to land on a meaningful point.
2. **Short Sessions**

   * Games are meant to last **1–3 minutes**, respecting eye strain and fatigue.
3. **Accessibility-First**

   * Playable with **no mouse** and minimal keyboard use.
   * Calibration and sensitivity tuned for **imperfect eye-tracking** and jitter.
4. **Toy Prototype, Not Esport**

   * The goal is a **fun demo** of gaze interaction, not a high-precision, high-APM game.

---

## Technical Overview

### Platform

* **OS:** macOS (Sonoma or newer)
* **Input:** macOS **Pointer Control** (Vision Accessibility – Eye Tracking / Head Pointer / Face Gestures)
* **Language / Framework:**
  + Example: `Swift + SpriteKit` (2D game framework)
  + But the concept is agnostic; any engine that can read pointer location and clicks will work.

### Input Model

The game **does not** implement its own raw eye-tracking.  
Instead it relies on:

* System pointer position = **gaze proxy**
* System "click" = **fire command**, whether generated by:
  + Dwell click
  + Blink gesture
  + Face gesture
  + Or traditional mouse click (for debugging)

This keeps the prototype aligned with **built-in macOS accessibility features** rather than external SDKs.

### Performance Considerations

The game polls pointer position at a consistent frame rate (targeting 60 FPS) with input smoothing applied to reduce gaze jitter. Dwell timing uses a rolling average of pointer stability rather than raw position to prevent false triggers from natural eye micro-movements.

---

## Game Loop (High-Level)

1. **Spawn missiles** at random positions along the top edge.
2. Each frame:
   * Move missiles along their trajectory toward chosen cities.
   * Check for **explosion collision** with missiles.
   * Remove destroyed missiles and trigger simple effects.
   * Detect **city impact** when missiles reach the ground.
3. Read current **pointer position** and display crosshair.
4. On **fire event** (click / dwell / blink):
   * Spawn interceptor at the nearest base or at ground level under the crosshair.
   * Interceptor travels upward then creates an **explosion circle**.
5. When all cities are destroyed:
   * Show **Game Over** screen with stats (time survived, missiles destroyed).
