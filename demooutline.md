# Sample Script with Visuals

**[TITLE SCREEN showing "Vision Command 2027"]**

"Vision Command 2027 is a gaze-controlled homage to Atari's 1980 game Missile Command, built entirely for macOS Vision Accessibility."

**[START game, cities visible at bottom of screen]**

"It demonstrates how modern operating system head-pointer control and gaze-dwelling can make classic arcade games accessible without any specialized hardware."

**[Reticle moves with gaze, enemy missiles begin spawning]**

"Players defend their cities by looking at incoming threats. Dwell your gaze to fire—"

**[First missile intercept, explosion, score updates]**

"—no hands, no controllers, just vision—turn your head."

**[Continue gameplay: 2-3 more intercepts, maybe one city gets hit]**

"Next steps include exploring facial-gesture-based firing as an alternative control scheme, and investigating deployment options for web or gaming consoles."

**[Fade to black or return to title screen]**

**Total runtime: ~45-60 seconds**
